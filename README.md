# Movies Shows / Angular 

Hello Angular!

I wanted to develop a simple project to get to know the angular framework. I used the json service and the http service structures and sent http requests via the json file created. There is a homepage where we can list the movie posters. The cards contain the movie title, star rating and price. We can view the details of the movie with the detail link. We can order or add products multiple times.


versions I used during development;

Node: v14.15.3
Angular: 11.0.9
AngularCLI: 11.0.7
Npm: 6.14.9

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
