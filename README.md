Hello Angular!

I wanted to develop a simple project to get to know the angular framework. I used the json service and the http service structures and sent http requests via the json file created. There is a homepage where we can list the movie posters. The cards contain the movie title, star rating and price. We can view the details of the movie with the detail link. We can order or add products multiple times.

## Versions I used during development;

 * Node: v14.15.3
 * Angular: 11.0.9
 * AngularCLI: 11.0.7
 * Npm: 6.14.9
